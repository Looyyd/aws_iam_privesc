# AWS IAM Privilege Escalation Tool
This tool is largely based on the work of RhinoSecurity Labs and [their deprecated script](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/Security-Research/blob/master/tools/aws-pentest-tools/aws_escalate.py) for testing IAM PrivEsc. I've updated the script with new methods and ported it to BlackArch Linux.
